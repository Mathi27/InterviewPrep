// How to Declare a Pointer :
/* Pointer Declaration:

To declare a pointer, use the dereferencing operator (*) followed by the data type.
   
   Syntax: 
   Datatype *var-name;
*/
//Example of Valid Pointer Variable Declarations

int    *ip;    /* pointer to an integer */
double *dp;    /* pointer to a double */
float  *fp;    /* pointer to a float */
char   *ch;     /* pointer to a character */

// Pointer Initialization :
int x = 10;
int *ptr = &x;

/**
 * The & Operator − It is also known as the "Address-of operator".
 * The * Operator − It is also known as the "dereference operator" It is used to get value at that memory location.
